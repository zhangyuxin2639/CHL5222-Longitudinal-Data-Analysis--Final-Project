Depression is a common mental health disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective, but theusual face-to-face therapy is expensive and dependent on the availability of trained therapists. As a result, an interactive multimedia program of CBT called Beating the Blues (BtheB) was developed. A randomized trialwas conducted in patients suffering from anxiety and/or depression. Each patient was randomly assigned to either receive BtheB therapy or treatment as usual (TAU). BtheB consisted of 8, 50-minute computerized weekly sessions with “homework” projects between sessions, while TAU consisted of whatever treatment the patient’s general practitioner (GP) prescribed, including drug treatment or referral to a counselor. Theprimary response was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), measured prior to treatment, at the end of treatment (2 months later), and at 2, 4, and 6 months follow-up visits.

Objective: To examine the efficacy of BtheB (in both the active treatment phase and the post-treatment follow-up)measured by BDI, controlling for potential confounding variables.
